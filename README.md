Personal sandbox of mini project and experiments I tinker with.

## Projects

- **CSPPlugin** – Custom Loupedeck plugin that fires shortcuts (tool switches, zoom, layer visibility, mute, etc.) so I can control Clip Studio Paint app on MacOS entirely from the console.
<!-- **Dictionary ChromeExtension** – The “LEO Quick Dictionary” Chrome extension; highlight a German word and instantly look it up on dict.leo.org.-->
- **ExpenseTracker** – Early-stage C++ expense tracker with an `Expense` model plus CLI/server scaffolding for logging purchases and categories.
- **Hamdam** – Empty Swift/Xcode shell for the HamDam iOS concept; currently just the asset catalog while I shape the app.
- **PipeNetwork** – C++ simulation that reads `pipedata.txt` and calculates flow rates for a Bavarian pipe network model.
- **Search ChromeExtension** – “Multi-Tab Find” Chrome extension that scans every open tab for a search term and walks the hits.
- **Subtitle ChromeExtention** – “Dual Subtitles” Chrome extension injecting stacked bilingual subtitles into any custom HTML5 video player.
- **TaskManagerCLI** – Menu-driven C++ task manager that adds, edits, filters, and persists todos through a simple repository interface.
<!--- **Portfolio landing page** – `index.html` and `style.css` form the WIP personal site that will surface the projects above.-->
